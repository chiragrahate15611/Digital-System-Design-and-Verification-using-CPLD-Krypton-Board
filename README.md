# Digital-System-Design-and-Verification-using-CPLD-Krypton-Board
I delved deep into the world of digital design, completing 26 diverse and 
challenging projects. From basic logic gates to complex sequence detectors 
and Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs) and a project of Traffic Signal controller using 
FSM logic, I explored the full spectrum of digital design.All of these projects were implemented on the 144c5 Krypton board MAXV using Quartus software version 18.1. 

I recently had the incredible opportunity to participate in a 2-week on-site workshop at the Wadhwani Electronics Lab (WEL) at IIT Bombay, organized by NPTEL. This intensive program focused on advanced digital design techniques using VHDL.

# Tools and Technologies:
- 144c5 Krypton Board MAXV: Gained hands-on experience with FPGA implementation, learning about hardware constraints and optimizations.

- Quartus Software v18.1: Utilized this powerful tool to design, synthesize, and simulate my projects, crucial for digital design engineers


# Course Highlights:
ðŸ”¹ AND , OR , XOR Gate Design Using Universal (NAND) gate & Half Adder and Full Adder: A foundational project that set the stage for understanding digital logic and VHDL.

ðŸ”¹ 4 Bit Adder and Subtractor: A foundational project that set the stage for understanding digital logic and VHDL. It contain some basic gates like XOR,AND,OR as basic module and perform addition and subtraction operation for 4 bit data.
